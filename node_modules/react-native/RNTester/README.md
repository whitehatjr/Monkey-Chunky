# RNTester

The RNTester showcases React Native views and modules.

## Running this app

Before running the app, make sure you ran:

    git clone https://github.com/facebook/react-native.git
    cd react-native
    npm install

### Running on iOS

Both macOS and Xcode are required.

- Install CocoaPods. We installing CocoaPods using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install cocoapods`
- Run `cd RNTester; pod install`
- Open the generated `RNTesterPods.xcworkspace`. This is not checked in, as it is generated by CocoaPods. Do not open `RNTesterPods.xcodeproj` directly.

### Running on Android

You'll need to have all the [prerequisites](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/ReactAndroid#prerequisites) (SDK, NDK) for Building React Native installed.

Start an Android emulator ([Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com) is recommended).

    cd react-native
    ./gradlew :RNTester:android:app:installDebug
    ./scripts/packager.sh

_Note: Building for the first time can take a while._

Open the RNTester app in your emulator.

See [Running on Device](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html) in case you want to use a physical device.

### Running with Buck

Follow the same setup as running with gradle.

Install Buck from [here](https://buckbuild.com/setup/install.html).

Run the following commands from the react-native folder:

    ./gradlew :ReactAndroid:packageReactNdkLibsForBuck
    buck fetch rntester
    buck install -r rntester
    ./scripts/packager.sh

_Note: The native libs are still built using gradle. Full build with buck is coming soon(tm)._

## Running Detox Tests on iOS

Install Detox from [here](https://github.com/wix/Detox/blob/master/docs/Introduction.GettingStarted.md).

To run the e2e tests locally, run the following commands from the react-native folder:

    yarn build-ios-e2e
    yarn test-ios-e2e

These are the equivalent of running:

    detox build -c ios.sim.release
    detox test -c ios.sim.release --cleanup

These build the app in Release mode, so the production code is bundled and included in the built app.

When developing E2E tests, you may want to run in development mode, so that changes to the production code show up immediately. To do this, run:

    detox build -c ios.sim.debug
    detox test -c ios.sim.debug

You will also need to have Metro Bundler running in another terminal. Note that if you've previously run the E2E tests in release mode, you may need to delete the `RNTester/build` folder before rerunning `detox build`.

## Building from source

Building the app on both iOS and Android means building the React Native framework from source. This way you're running the latest native and JS code the way you see it in your clone of the github repo.

This is different from apps created using `react-native init` which have a dependency on a specific version of React Native JS and native code, declared in a `package.json` file (and `build.gradle` for Android apps).
