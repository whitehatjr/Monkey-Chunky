## Try it out

You can try it out with Expo [here](https://expo.io/@monte9/react-native-ratings). Or you can also run the [`example`](https://github.com/Monte9/react-native-ratings/tree/master/react_native_ratings_example) app locally.


## Motivation

One of my friends showed me [this](https://github.com/kartik-v/bootstrap-star-rating/) [Star Rating feature in Bootstrap](http://plugins.krajee.com/star-rating-demo-theme-default) and it looks really interesting. So I challenged myself to re-implement it in React Native.

Followed by that, for `v3`, I recreated the Airbnb ratings component and added it to this repo, in case others find this useful. It works out of the box and is quite functional.

Also this is my first [`npm module`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-ratings) :confetti_ball:
