# Installation in managed Expo projects

For managed [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation). If you follow the link and there is no documentation available then this library is not yet usable within managed projects &mdash; it is likely to be included in an upcoming Expo SDK release.

# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `react-native-unimodules` package](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules) before continuing.

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

```
expo install expo-location
```

### Configure for iOS

Add `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`, `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` and `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` keys to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>
```

Run `pod install` in the ios directory after installing the npm package.

### Configure for Android
